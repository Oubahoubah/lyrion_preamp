# lyrion_preamp
Lyrion_preamp is a small utility that runs as a daemon on a squeezelite server to which a multimedia pad is attached to. It captures volume, play, pause, mute, next, prev presses and sends them across to the Lyrion server. This allows for a consistent status of the system across all clients (mobile, local, ...).
